## Chat App Overview

This chat application allows users to create and join servers, which serve as individual spaces for communication. Each **server** can have multiple **channels**, and each **channel** can host discussions on different topics. Additionally, channels have **members** who participate in the conversation within that specific channel.

### Key Features
- **Servers**: Create and join servers to organize your discussions.
- **Channels**: Each server contains multiple channels, allowing for topic-based conversations.
